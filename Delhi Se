One thing that every North Indian craves in Mumbai is a good plate of Chhole Bhatoore. Piping hot bhatoore and earthy, spicy, rich chhole !!!
In my quest, the first place that I went to was the much-hyped "Delhi Se" restaurant in Chembur. A place that was hyped by stand-up comedian "Abhishek Upmanyu" and further recommended by Bollywood stalwart "Anushka Sharma". Anushka claimed that this was the only place which was able to get passing marks from her husband and cricketer "Virat Kohli".
After an hour of travel and another 40 minutes of waiting, we got a shared table. Pro tip: Visit the place around 3:30-4 to get a table quickly.
We ordered Chhole Bhatoore and Rajma Chawal. 
Bhatoore were nice and fluffy. Chhole were a tad bit bland to my taste. Verdict 7/10

Rajwa CHawal hit home with its perfect texture and taste. The sourness from the tomatoes was well-balanced, the gravy was perfectly thick and very well-seasoned. The accompanying fried papad were good to go and added value to the meal. Verdict: 8.5/10

Lassi: 8/10. Could have been a bit less sweet but I liked it.
The Dahi Bhalle were soft and succulent. Well spiced and packed a punch with all the right chutneys and seasonings.

In all, visit it if you are craving a good Delhi meal, it won't disappoint much :)
